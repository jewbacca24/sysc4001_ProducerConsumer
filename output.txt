Even though the song is called "Shut Up", the two words do not appear in the lyrics at all. However, they were the final words of an additional verse which was part of an early version of the song.

LYRICS:

Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up

[Chorus]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losing control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy
For trying to be your laaadddy
I think I'm going crazy

Girl, me and you were just fine (you know)
We wine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love (you know)
Walks on the beach and stuff (you know)
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That's why I flew you out
When we was on tour
But then something got out of hand
You start yelling when I'm with my friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons (bull shit)
You know I have to make them dividends (bull shit)
How could you trust our private lives girl
That's why you don't believe my lies
And quick to say

[Chorus]

Why does emotion gotta move so fast
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on taking it slow
So why does it got to be so damn tough
'cause fools in lust could never get enough of love
Showing him the love that you be giving
Changing up your living
For a loving transition
Girl its a mission trying to get you to listen
Few mad at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street saying
“Who the hell?!?”
Who the hell?
What the hell's going down?
Too much of the bickering
Kill it with the sound and

[Chorus]

Girl our love is dying
Why did you stop trying
I never been a quitah
But I do deserve betta
Believe me I will do bad
Let's forget the past
And let's start this new plan
Why? 'cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'cause I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you're useless
Woooaaahhh!!!

[Chorus]

Stop the talking baby
Or I start walking baby [repeat]
Is that all there is [repeat till fade]

Why? 'cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'cause I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you're useless
Woooaaahhh!!!

[Chorus]

Stop the talking baby
Or I start walking baby [repeat]
Is that all there is [repeat till fade]


Next Time:

What will the SYSC 4001 TA think of our assignment? Will we succeed...or will we crash & burn?!? Stay tuned for scenes from the next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
The song tells a story of a criminal who, despite obvious evidence, tries to convince people he is not guilty. Even though the song is called "Shut Up", the two words do not appear in the lyrics at all. However, they were the final words of an additional verse which was part of an early version of the song.

LYRICS:

Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up

[Chorus]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losing control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy
For trying to be your laaadddy
I think I'm going crazy

Girl, me and you were just fine (you know)
We wine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love (you know)
Walks on the beach and stuff (you know)
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That's why I flew you out
When we was on tour
But then something got out of hand
You start yelling when I'm with my friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons (bull shit)
You know I have to make them dividends (bull shit)
How could you trust our private lives girl
That's why you don't believe my lies
And quick to say

[Chorus]

Why does emotion gotta move so fast
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on taking it slow
So why does it got to be so damn tough
'cause fools in lust could never get enough of love
Showing him the love that you be giving
Changing up your living
For a loving transition
Girl its a mission trying to get you to listen
Few mad at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street saying
“Who the hell?!?”
Who the hell?
What the hell's going down?
Too much of the bickering
Kill it with the sound and

[Chorus]

Girl our love is dying
Why did you stop trying
I never been a quitah
But I do deserve betta
Believe me I will do bad
Let's forget the past
And let's start this new plan
Why? 'cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'cause I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you're useless
Woooaaahhh!!!

The song tells a story of a criminal who, despite obvious evidence, tries to convince people he is not guilty. Even though the song is called "Shut Up", the two words do not appear in the lyrics at all. However, they were the final words of an additional verse which was part of an early version of the song.

LYRICS:

Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up

[Chorus]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losing control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy
For trying to be your laaadddy
I think I'm going crazy

Girl, me and you were just fine (you know)
We wine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love (you know)
Walks on the beach and stuff (you know)
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That's why I flew you out
When we was on tour
But then something got out of hand
You start yelling when I'm with my friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons (bull shit)
You know I have to make them dividends (bull shit)
How could you trust our private lives girl
That's why you don't believe my lies
And quick to say

[Chorus]

Why does emotion gotta move so fast
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on taking it slow
So why does it got to be so damn tough
'cause fools in lust could never get enough of love
Showing him the love that you be giving
Changing up your living
For a loving transition
Girl its a mission trying to get you to listen
Few mad at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street saying
“Who the hell?!?”
Who the hell?
What the hell's going down?
Too much of the bickering
Kill it with the sound and

[Chorus]

Girl our love is dying
Why did you stop trying
I never been a quitah
But I do deserve betta
Believe me I will do bad
Let's forget the past
And let's start this new plan
Why? 'cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'cause I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you're useless
Woooaaahhh!!!

[Chorus]

Stop the talking baby
Or I start walking baby [repeat]
Is that all there is [repeat till fade]

Shut it up, just shut up
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up

[Chorus]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losing control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy
For trying to be your laaadddy
I think I'm going crazy

Girl, me and you were just fine (you know)
We wine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love (you know)
Walks on the beach and stuff (you know)
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That's why I flew you out
When we was on tour
But then something got out of hand
You start yelling when I'm with my friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons (bull shit)
You know I have to make them dividends (bull shit)
How could you trust our private lives girl
That's why you don't believe my lies
And quick to say

[Chorus]

Why does emotion gotta move so fast
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on taking it slow
So why does it got to be so damn tough
'cause fools in lust could never get enough of love
Showing him the love that you be giving
Changing up your living
For a loving transition
Girl its a mission trying to get you to listen
Few mad at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street saying
“Who the hell?!?”
Who the hell?
What the hell's going down?
Too much of the bickering
Kill it with the sound and

[Chorus]

Girl our love is dying
Why did you stop trying
I never been a quitah
But I do deserve betta
Believe me I will do bad
Let's forget the past
And let's start this new plan
Why? 'cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'cause I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you're useless
Woooaaahhh!!!

[Chorus]

Stop the talking baby
Or I start walking baby [repeat]
Is that all there is [repeat till fade]


Next Time:

The song tells a story of a criminal who, despite obvious evidence, tries to convince people he is not guilty. Even though the song is called "Shut Up", the two words do not appear in the lyrics at all. However, they were the final words of an additional verse which was part of an early version of the song.
